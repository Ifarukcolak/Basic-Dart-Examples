# Basic examples of Dart Programming Language

## Introduction
***
I have heard of something Dart and then read some Medium posts about **Dart**'s performance, easy-learn,and similiarty with Java. 
Many people as me heard about Dart with **Flutter** that is used to develop mobile applications for Android and Ios platforms. 
So, I decided to start somewhere :)
Thanks to [w3adda](https://www.w3adda.com) community for [this tutorial about Dart](https://www.w3adda.com/dart-tutorial/dart-introduction).
Generally I read this documentation,did some changes on code and I added extra samples. 

## Installing
***
*If there is Flutter on your computer, do not follow this step.*

There are two ways to work with Dart; [local](https://dart.dev/get-dart) or [online](https://dartpad.dartlang.org/). 
After download and install Dart Sdk on your local computer, just type Dart to verify your installation then you will see  Dart commands.

```
dart
```
